# Task-8-Working-with-VPNs
Explored VPNs by signing up for a free service, installing the client, and connecting to a server. Verified IP changes and encrypted traffic, compared browsing speed, researched encryption and privacy features, and summarized benefits and limitations. Learned how VPNs secure data, protect privacy, and maintain anonymity online.

In this project, I explored VPNs by selecting a reputable free service, installing the client, and connecting to different servers. I verified that my IP address changed and that browsing traffic was encrypted. I also compared internet speed with and without the VPN. Additionally, I researched VPN encryption methods and privacy features like AES-256 encryption, secure tunneling protocols, kill switches, and DNS leak protection. Finally, I summarized the benefits, such as enhanced security, privacy, and anonymity, and the limitations, including potential slower speeds and restrictions on certain websites. This hands-on exercise helped me understand how VPNs safeguard online activity and protect sensitive data.
